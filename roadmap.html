    The EtherGem Whitepaper is currently being updated to include the details of our integrated subchain. While this is in progress, here are
    some basics about the EGEM Chain:

    <p>
      Ethergem is the foundational currency platform with an integrated subchain that starts by replicating the stable ethereum core to avoid
      a reinvention of the wheel and focus on the solutions needed for a decentralized Marketplace. The integration of a subchain allows for
      tokens to become coins with their own blockchain and consensus while maintaining the dapp infrastructure we have become accustomed to.
      The resulting chain structure adds enhancements to scalability, transactional throughput, and technical capabilities available on very
      few platforms in today's crypto environment.

        EtherGem, "EGEM," is first and foremost a pure community-based coin with no pre mine. True to EGEM’s roots as a cryptocurrency,
        the Proof of Work mining community will always be a part of the EGEM future and is the foundation of the EGEM launch.
        There is no ICO on EGEM and EGEM is its own primary blockchain, not just a token or concept on another chain. The EtherGem
        blockchain is an ethereum network, meaning the blockchain starts with the tested and proven ethereum (as in ETH) core technologies
        and builds from there. Technically EGEM is an Ethereum chain as described in the yellow paper, with EIP150, EIP155, EIP158
        applied from block 0. Block Rewards have 7 Eras of reduction, including a dev reward enabled after block 5000. Developers
        and Community Managers are bound by a continuity agreement to maintain the network, community, and coin. There is no supply
        cap to EGEM at the moment. A monetary cap will be put in place when the community determines that a logical progression would be
        to cap the total supply of the coin.

        Our Roadmap is evolving....<br />
        EtherGem started with a stable core of Ethereum and changed the difficulty and block time. We then began adding enhancements like the
        Quarrynodes and integrated subchain. Since March (our launch) we have ben listed on multiple exchanges, refined our stable core, released
        the Quarrynodes, a custom desktop wallet, built a terrific discord and telegram community, attended the Blockchain World Conference, hosted
        an ICO (Validity - formerly Division X) on our chain, developed the integrated subchain in the labs, and planned out a fantastic 2019. It is now
        time to formalize our plans and hidden technology in the upcoming whitepaper. The plans for this release are in sync with the Sapphire
        testnet and should be in the next quarter. At that time we will provide the roadmap for the next year or two.
      </li>
      <li style="border:1px solid #CCCC; padding:20px; margin:20px; background-color:#ffffe6;">
        An "applied technologies peernet" is the EtherGem blockchain’s integrated subchain structure. Dual mining EtherGem and an integrated coin on
        claymore is something new. The EGEM integrated subchain (code named Sapphire) is designed to be a platform that enhances the EGEM experience
        by allowing other coins to list on it as a Decentralized Exchange (DEX).
        Sapphire is very much an integral part of ongoing mainchain development where peers can implement new technology while continuing to rely on a
        solid foundation.  The Sapphire subchain is currently in late stage development and early testing in the EGEM labs. We expect to see this product
        release over the next quarter. A lot of excitement is surrounding the Sapphire subchain because early EGEM miners and HODLers get a 2:1 Sapphire : EGEM
        airdrop at a to be released snapshot. Combined with the Quarrynodes, we feel that the sponsored Sapphire expansion will bring the EtherGem chain into
        mainstream use.

      <li style="border:1px solid #CCCC; padding:20px; margin:20px; background-color:#ffffe6;">
        Quarry Nodes grow the EtherGem network. The Quarry Nodes are in production as a beta project for early adopters at this time. Our
        Goals for the Quarrynode program is to bring the main chain and the upcoming integrated subchain (Sapphire) together on the network in
        a way that benefits the entire community with rewards and a stable network.
        Staking and earning in both Sapphire and even sometimes in EGEM
        <ul>
          <li>A form of masternode to maintain network and uptime.</li>
          <li>Sponsored mining rewards tokens used on sidechain and strengthens the EGEM chain.</li>
          <li>Quarry Link Node collateral will equate to 100k EGEM and locks in both Sapphire and EGEM (A Quarry Link will be the link between the two chains, and the gateway to the expandable features).</li>
          <li>Multiple tiers for miners, sponsors and super hosts</li>
          <li>Keep the Quarry link wallet/software open and earn.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
